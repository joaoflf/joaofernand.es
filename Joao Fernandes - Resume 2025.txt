Jo‹o FernandesPorto, Portugal ¥ (+351) 935163412 ¥ joaoflfernandes@gmail.comhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/joaoflf/ ¥ https://github.com/joaoflf/I am an engineering leader with 14+ years of experience building and scaling software engineering organizations and teams in both startup and enterprise environments. I love the challenge of growing teams and building products that solve complex problems at scale.At Five9, my teams build and maintain the organization's core data platform. We architect and build the systems that ingest millions of events per second and process dozens of terabytes of data daily,providing the critical data backbone for all of Five9's internal and customer-facing products like real-time APIs, event providers, and AI-powered analytics applications.My technical interests are in machine learning, AI and a bit of distributed systems. I enjoy implementing and experimenting with concepts from research papers and sharing my findings on my blog, Calculated Randomness, and through the Machine Learning Porto meetup, which I founded to build a community of ML enthusiasts in Porto. You can find my projects on my github at https://github.com/joaoflf and my newsletter at https://calculatedrandomness.substack.com/PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCEDirector of Engineering / Five9		                                                                              (May 2023)-Present?
